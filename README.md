# Temperature-control-and-presion-measure


I have used a control algorithm with the control library from arduino to build a control system with temperature. Adding to this, I made an equation with a 15 psi pressure analog sensor to make a read in psi and mmHg.

This system was implemented as conditioner that we needed to make some material test, so you can easily change all the values if you need.

I used an Arduino as microcontroller, a six thermocouple with the MAX6675, a heating resistance and an analaog 15psi-pressure sensor.
